# ETL System Architecture

## Overview

The ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) system is a comprehensive framework for managing data pipelines within the GeospatialAnalyzerBS platform. It provides capabilities for extracting data from various sources, transforming it according to business rules, validating data quality, and loading the processed data into destination systems.

## Core Components

### Data Flow

1. **Extract**: Data is extracted from source systems (databases, APIs, files, or in-memory data structures)
2. **Transform**: Data undergoes transformations through configurable transformation rules
3. **Quality Analysis**: Data quality is analyzed and issues are identified
4. **Load**: Processed data is loaded into destination systems

### Key Services

- **ETLPipelineManager**: Coordinates the overall ETL process, manages jobs, schedules, and resources
- **ETLPipeline**: Executes individual pipeline runs
- **DataConnector**: Handles connections to data sources and destinations
- **TransformationService**: Applies transformation rules to data
- **DataQualityService**: Analyzes data quality and identifies issues
- **Scheduler**: Manages job scheduling and execution timing
- **AlertService**: Provides notifications about ETL events and issues

## Service Details

### ETLPipelineManager

Central orchestration service that manages:
- Job definitions and configurations
- Data source and destination configurations 
- Transformation rule definitions
- Job execution and scheduling
- System status monitoring

### DataConnector

Handles data source connections and data movement:
- Connection testing and validation
- Data extraction with filtering and pagination
- Data loading with various modes (insert, update, upsert)
- Metadata retrieval from data sources

Supported data source types:
- Databases (PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQL Server, etc.)
- APIs (REST, GraphQL, SOAP)
- Files (CSV, JSON, XML, etc.)
- In-memory data structures

### TransformationService

Applies various transformation operations to data:
- Filtering data based on conditions
- Mapping fields and structures
- Aggregating data with functions (sum, avg, count, etc.)
- Grouping data by fields
- Joining data from multiple sources
- Sorting data based on fields
- Validating data against rules
- Enriching data from external sources

### DataQualityService

Analyzes data quality and identifies issues:
- Checks for missing values
- Validates data types and formats
- Detects outliers and anomalies
- Identifies duplicates
- Checks for consistency between related fields
- Applies custom validation rules
- Computes quality scores
- Generates recommendations for quality improvement

### Scheduler

Manages job scheduling and execution:
- Supports various frequency types (once, hourly, daily, weekly, monthly)
- Handles time zone configuration
- Manages job dependencies and execution order
- Provides job execution history and status tracking

### AlertService

Notification system for ETL events and issues:
- Provides alerts with different severity levels
- Categorizes alerts by system area
- Supports various notification channels (in-app, email, Slack, webhooks)
- Manages alert lifecycle (new, acknowledged, resolved, closed)
- Offers filtering and query capabilities for alerts

## Configuration and Customization

### ETL Job Configuration

An ETL job is defined with:
- Source data connections
- Destination data connections
- Transformation rules
- Schedule configuration
- Quality validation settings
- Error handling preferences

### Transformation Rules

Transformation rules can be configured with:
- Rule type (filter, map, aggregate, etc.)
- Rule-specific configuration (filter conditions, field mappings, etc.)
- Execution order
- Enable/disable flag

### Data Quality Rules

Data quality can be analyzed with:
- Field inclusion/exclusion settings
- Validation rule definitions
- Quality thresholds and weightings
- Custom validation functions

## Best Practices

1. **Data Source Management**:
   - Test connections before scheduling jobs
   - Use appropriate authentication and security measures
   - Configure proper timeouts and retry logic

2. **Transformation Design**:
   - Keep transformations modular and focused
   - Order transformations logically (filter early, aggregate late)
   - Use appropriate transformation types for each task

3. **Data Quality**:
   - Define quality thresholds based on business requirements
   - Monitor quality scores over time to identify trends
   - Address critical quality issues promptly

4. **Error Handling**:
   - Configure appropriate error thresholds
   - Set up alerts for critical failures
   - Implement retry logic for transient errors

5. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Use batch processing for large datasets
   - Implement incremental processing when possible
   - Monitor execution times and resource usage
