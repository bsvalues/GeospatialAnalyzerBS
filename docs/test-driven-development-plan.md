# Test-Driven Development Plan for GIS_BS

## Overview

This document outlines our test-driven development (TDD) approach for the GIS_BS platform. Following TDD principles, we'll write tests before implementing features, ensuring that our code is robust, maintainable, and meets requirements from the start.

## Current Status

The following core tests are now stable and passing:
- ApplicationStructure.test.ts - Verifies critical files, component exports, and core routes
- AppStartup.test.ts - Confirms the application renders without crashing
- Basic.test.tsx - Validates basic component rendering

## TDD Process

For each new feature or enhancement, we'll follow this process:

1. **Write Test First**: Create tests that define the expected behavior before writing any implementation code
2. **Run the Test**: Verify that the test fails initially (as expected since implementation doesn't exist)
3. **Implement the Feature**: Write the minimum code necessary to make the test pass
4. **Run All Tests**: Verify the new code passes both its specific test and doesn't break existing functionality
5. **Refactor**: Clean up and optimize the code while ensuring all tests continue to pass

## Testing Strategy by Component Type

### UI Components
- Visual rendering tests
- Interaction tests (clicks, form submissions)
- State management tests
- Responsive behavior tests

### Services and Data Handling
- API integration tests
- Data transformation tests
- Error handling tests
- Authentication and authorization tests

### Geospatial Features
- Map rendering tests
- Layer management tests
- Spatial analysis tests
- Geolocation and proximity tests

## Test Coverage Goals

- Core Framework: 90%+ coverage
- Business Logic: 80%+ coverage
- UI Components: 75%+ coverage
- Integration Points: 85%+ coverage

## Mocking Strategy

- External APIs: Mock responses for consistent testing
- Geospatial Libraries: Provide mock implementations of Leaflet and related libraries
- Backend Services: Mock server responses for frontend testing
- Complex Components: Create simplified mock versions for testing parent components

## Continuous Integration

All tests will be integrated into the CI pipeline to:
- Run on every push
- Run on every pull request
- Generate coverage reports
- Block merging when tests fail

## Feature Test Plan

### Phase 1: Property Analysis Features

1. **Property Comparison Tool**
   - Test file: PropertyComparisonTool.test.tsx
   - Test cases:
     - Renders with property data
     - Handles selection of multiple properties
     - Displays comparison metrics accurately
     - Exports comparison data

2. **Neighborhood Scoring**
   - Test file: NeighborhoodScoreCard.test.tsx
   - Test cases:
     - Calculates scores correctly
     - Renders score visualization
     - Handles missing data appropriately
     - Updates on data changes

3. **Spatial Clustering**
   - Test file: SpatialClustering.test.ts
   - Test cases:
     - Creates accurate clusters from sample data
     - Handles edge cases (empty datasets, outliers)
     - Performance tests for large datasets
     - Visual representation tests

### Phase 2: Reporting and Visualization

1. **Report Generator**
   - Test file: ReportGenerator.test.ts
   - Test cases:
     - Generates PDF reports with correct data
     - Includes all required USPAP elements
     - Handles various property types
     - Error cases and fallbacks

2. **Trend Analysis Charts**
   - Test file: TrendAnalysisCharts.test.tsx
   - Test cases:
     - Renders charts with sample data
     - Handles time series data correctly
     - Supports different chart types
     - Interactive elements work as expected

3. **Export Capabilities**
   - Test file: ExportService.test.ts
   - Test cases:
     - Exports to different formats (CSV, JSON, PDF)
     - Handles large datasets
     - Includes proper metadata
     - Security and permissions

### Phase 3: Advanced Geospatial Features

1. **Heat Map Visualization**
   - Test file: HeatMapVisualization.test.tsx
   - Test cases:
     - Renders heat map based on property data
     - Color gradient matches configuration
     - Handles zoom and pan operations
     - Performance with large datasets

2. **Proximity Analysis**
   - Test file: ProximityAnalysis.test.ts
   - Test cases:
     - Calculates distances accurately
     - Finds nearest points of interest
     - Handles geographic boundaries
     - Buffer analysis tests

3. **Regression Analysis**
   - Test file: RegressionAnalysis.test.ts
   - Test cases:
     - Calculates regression models correctly
     - Handles different regression types
     - Produces valid statistics (RÂ², p-values)
     - Visualization of regression results

## Implementation Plan

1. Start with high-priority features identified in the product roadmap
2. Create test files following the test plan before implementation
3. Implement one feature at a time, completing its test suite before moving on
4. Regular refactoring sessions to maintain code quality
5. Weekly test coverage reviews to identify gaps

## Conclusion

By following this test-driven development approach, we will build a more robust and reliable GIS_BS platform. The focus on testing first ensures that our features meet requirements and remain stable through future development iterations.
