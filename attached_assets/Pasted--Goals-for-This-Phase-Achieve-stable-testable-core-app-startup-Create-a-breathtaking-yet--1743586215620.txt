**Goals for This Phase**
- Achieve stable, testable core app startup.
- Create a breathtaking yet minimal visual experience.
- Design a test suite that becomes the backbone of future development.
- Validate core workflows and critical paths before expanding.
---
## 🔧 Minimal Setup (Stable Foundation)
**Core Features to Implement:**
- 🚀 App Startup & Welcome Screen
- Apple-tier minimalist loading animation (tailwind + subtle motion)
- Welcome message with philosophical prompt or knowledge teaser
- 📐 Design System Base
- Tailwind + ShadCN UI setup
- Typography + spacing scale that screams quality
- Responsive grid & layout scaffold
- 🌐 Routing (if web-based)
- Minimal navigation: `Home`, `About`, `Get Smarter`
---
## ✅ Core Tests to Run Now
We’ll run these before anything else to ensure the base is reliable:
### 1. **App Startup**
- [ ] App initializes without errors
- [ ] Welcome screen renders correctly
- [ ] Responsive layout loads on all screen sizes
### 2. **Design System Verification**
- [ ] Tailwind classes render as expected
- [ ] ShadCN component example loads (e.g., button, card)
- [ ] Color palette and fonts match intended design
### 3. **Visual Sanity Checks**
- [ ] No overflowing elements or layout shifts
- [ ] Mobile nav/menu displays as intended
- [ ] Light/dark mode toggles correctly (if included)

## 🧪 Phase 1: Pre-Coding Test Suite
Here’s the **test spec** before we write a single line of new code:
### 🧪 `tests/ui.test.tsx`
```ts
describe("Initial UI Load", () => {
it("should render the welcome screen", () => {
render();
expect(screen.getByText(/welcome/i)).toBeInTheDocument();
});
it("should have a responsive layout", () => {
// Simulate window resize
global.innerWidth = 320;
fireEvent(window, new Event("resize"));
// Check for mobile nav or specific UI change
expect(screen.getByTestId("mobile-nav")).toBeVisible();
});
});
```

## 📈 Phase 2 Planning (Coming Next)
Once Phase 1 is stable and beautiful:
- 🧠 Knowledge modules (visual walkthroughs, interactive learning)
- 🗂 AI-powered semantic search through in-app content
- 📚 Smart bookmarks + knowledge journaling
- 🧭 Guided “deep dives” with unlockable content
---
## 🔁 Plan Review – Self-Audit
**Potential Issues to Watch For:**
- Over-investing in animation before the core UX is stable
- Ignoring accessibility in favor of visual aesthetics
- Building components without test coverage from the start
**Opportunities to Improve:**
- Make visual polish testable with visual regression tools (e.g., Percy)
- Embed an Easter egg or subtle delight moment on first load
- Treat the welcome screen like a trailer to a movie: deliver awe
